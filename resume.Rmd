### Research and intern

#### bioinformatics

Internship in Industry: 

* *(Jiaofu Research Company, 2017.7 - 2017.10)* Developed transcriptomics microarray analyze pipeline for TCGA tumor data, including differential expression analysis and mRNA-microRNA-lncRNA/circRNA coexpression network.

Research Assistant:

* *(Prof. Li Lab in SJTU, 2015.9 - 2017.9)* Participated in bioinformatics research, learned the basic analyze pipeline and software. Got to know MS-based high throughput technologies.

Syndrome Biomarker Detect:

* *(Prof. Zhao Lab in SJTU, 2016.9 - 2017.2)* Cooperatively discovered metabolic biomarkers and pathways in Angelman Syndrome and Prader-Willi Syndrome. Learned how to use online tool XCMS.

Proteogenomics Program:

* *(Prof. Li Lab in SJTU, 2016.10 - 2017.9)* Participated in the integrated proteogenomic characterization of cancers. Did multi-feature clustering, and protein coexpression network analysis in big-data research.

#### biostatistics

Statistical Model Comparison:

* *(Prof. Li Lab in SJTU, 2015.12 - 2017.12)* Took the whole process of proposing a biological network module-based zero-augmented generalized linear model for differential expression analysis of spectral count data.

R Software Development:

* *(Prof. Li Lab in SJTU, 2016.10 - 2017.12)* Leaded a 3-member team to implement an integrated R software that can identify differentially expressed modules through a specific pipeline, also provided visualized output.

Rice PPI Database:

* *(Prof. Li Lab in SJTU, 2017.11 - 2018.2)* Took in charge of refining the Na√Øve Bayesian classifier and database, was going to put more resources to the classifier and optimize the user interface.
